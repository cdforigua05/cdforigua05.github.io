In this seminar, I presented the paper *“High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models”* by Rombach et al., from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, IWR at Heidelberg University, and Runway ML. This influential work, accepted at CVPR 2022, introduces a novel approach to high-quality image generation by performing diffusion in a compressed latent space, enabling both efficiency and state-of-the-art synthesis results.
