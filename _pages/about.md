Hi there!

I'm an AI Engineer & Researcher with strong background in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My previous work spans **Egocentric Vision, 3D Recognition, 3D Scene Understanding, Biomedical Imaging, and Bioinformatics**.

I hold a **Master’s in Biomedical Engineering** and dual **Bachelor’s degrees in Systems & Computing Engineering and Biomedical Engineering** from *Universidad de los Andes* (Colombia). I have contributed to research at the [Center for Research and Formation in Artificial Intelligence (CinfonIA)](https://cinfonia.uniandes.edu.co/), resulting in publications at top-tier venues such as **CVPR, WACV, and MICCAI**.

Currently, I work as an **AI Integration Engineer** at **ReBlink** (Toronto), integrating diffusion-based generative AI for 2D/3D asset creation and LLM-powered systems for interactive video game experiences.

I am **currently seeking PhD opportunities** where I can advance research at the intersection of **Egocentric Vision and 3D Computer Vision**. My research interests include **open-world 3D scene understanding and human–object interaction reasoning**. I am particularly interested in developing multimodal models that integrate **visual, spatial, and language information** to identify and segment seen and unseen objects, while reasoning about their affordances and interactions in complex, dynamic 3D environments. My goal is to create **human-centric, generalizable systems** that bridge perception and action, enabling more natural and seamless human-AI collaboration.
