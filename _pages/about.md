Hi there!  

I am an AI Engineer and Researcher with a strong background in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, specializing in **Egocentric Vision, 3D Recognition, Biomedical Imaging, and Bioinformatics**. I hold a Master’s in Biomedical Engineering and dual Bachelor’s degrees in Systems & Computing Engineering and Biomedical Engineering from *Universidad de los Andes* (Colombia). I have conducted research at the [Center for Research and Formation in Artificial Intelligence (CinfonIA)](https://cinfonia.uniandes.edu.co/) under the supervision of Prof. [Pablo Arbeláez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=k0nZO90AAAAJ), resulting in publications at top-tier venues such as **CVPR, WACV, and MICCAI**.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of **egocentric vision** and **3D computer vision**, with a focus on **open-world 3D scene understanding and human–object interaction reasoning**. I am particularly interested in developing multimodal models that integrate visual, spatial, and language information to enable richer understanding and interaction in complex, dynamic environments.  

**I am currently seeking PhD opportunities** to further this line of research.
