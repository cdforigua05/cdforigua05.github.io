Hi there!

I'm an AI Engineer & Researcher with strong background in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My previous work spans **Egocentric Vision, 3D Recognition, 3D Scene Understanding, Biomedical Imaging, and Bioinformatics**.

I hold a Master’s in Biomedical Engineering and dual Bachelor’s degrees in Systems & Computing Engineering and Biomedical Engineering from Universidad de los Andes (Colombia). I have contributed to research at the [Center for Research and Formation in Artificial Intelligence (CinfonIA)](https://cinfonia.uniandes.edu.co/), working under Professor [Pablo Arbeláez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=k0nZO90AAAAJ), which resulted in publications at top-tier venues such as CVPR, WACV, and MICCAI.

Currently, I work as an AI Integration Engineer at ReBlink (Toronto), integrating diffusion-based **generative AI for 2D/3D asset creation and LLM-powered systems** for interactive video game experiences.

I am **currently seeking PhD opportunities** where I can advance research at the intersection of <span style="color:#102542;"><b><strong>Egocentric Vision and 3D Computer Vision</strong></b></span>. My research interests include <span style="color:#102542;"><b><strong>open-world 3D scene understanding and human–object interaction reasoning</strong></b></span>. I am particularly interested in developing multimodal models that integrate visual, spatial, and language information to identify and segment seen and unseen objects, while reasoning about their affordances and interactions in complex, dynamic 3D environments. My goal is **to create human-centric, generalizable systems** that bridge perception and action, enabling more natural and seamless human-AI collaboration.
